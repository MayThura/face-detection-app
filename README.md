# Face Detection Camera App

##Project Overview

The Face Detection Camera App is an innovative Android application designed to enhance photography by integrating advanced face detection technology. Built with the robust OpenCV library, this app not only captures images using the device's camera but also intelligently detects faces within the frame, automatically focusing on them to ensure clarity and precision in every shot.

##Key Features
- Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes live camera feed to detect faces in real time, highlighting them with a detection box.
- Auto-Focus on Faces: Automatically adjusts focus to the detected faces, ensuring they are always captured with clear detail.
- Gallery Integration: Saves captured images with face detection into the Android device's gallery, allowing for easy access and sharing.
- OpenCV Powered: Leverages the powerful image processing capabilities of the OpenCV library for efficient and accurate face detection.
